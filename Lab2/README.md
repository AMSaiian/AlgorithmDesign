# Lab 2. N-queens problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The problem of 8-queens is to place eight queens on the chessboard so that none of them puts each other under attack. So, they should not stand in one vertical, horizontal or diagonal.  
To solve this problem a search algorithm need to be used which can be informed and uninformed. To trust an advantage of informed over
uninformed let's compare efficiency of them.  
### **Informed search algorithm:** A* (A-Star)
### **Uninformed search algorithm:** IDS (Iterative Deepening Search)
