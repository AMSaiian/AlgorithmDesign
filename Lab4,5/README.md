# Lab 4. Vertex coloring problem. Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm implementation for graph coloring and finding minimal chromatic number in C++. It is based on article "Vertex Coloring Based on Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm" by Vahid Chahkandi and Omid Mirzaei.  
Random 100-vertexes graph is generated with vertex degrees from 1 up to 20. Algorithm runs 1000 times. Each iteration can improve our minimal chromatic number.
